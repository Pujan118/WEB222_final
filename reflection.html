        --> Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean?<br>
        Responsive design is a method of creating web pages that employs
        flexible layouts, flexible graphics, and media queries in the form of
        cascading style sheets. The purpose of responsive design is to create
        web pages that recognise the size and orientation of the visitor's
        screen and adjust the layout accordingly.Responsive design is a somewhat retro approach to web site design that addresses many of the design issues that have arisen as a result of the growth of new sorts of mobile devices. Instead of fixed-width settings, responsive design pages employ X and Y coordinates on a grid for layout and mathematical percentages for pictures. Using percentages instead of fixed-width parameters with a grid layout results in a more fluid layout that adapts to the size of the display.<br>
    
    <br>        --> How does responsive design relate to web technologies? <br>
        Responsive web design, often known as RWD design, is a current web design strategy that allows websites and pages to render (or display) across all devices and screen sizes by changing to the screen automatically, whether it's a desktop, laptop, tablet, or smartphone. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used in responsive web design to serve different style properties based on the screen size, orientation, resolution, colour capability, and other features of the user's device. Viewport and media queries are two examples of CSS properties that are relevant to responsive web design.<br>

    <br>        --> What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your research? <br>
        Web app is an interactive computer program, built with web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS), which stores (Database, Files) and manipulates data (CRUD), and is used by a team or single user to perform tasks over the internet. To make a proper web app we need to understand:
        <br><br>
        1) Backend language (e.g. Python, Ruby) - control how your web app works
    <br>    2) Web front end (HTML, CSS, Javascript) - for the look and feel of your web app
    <br>    3) DevOps (Github, Jenkins) - Deploying / hosting your web app
<br>
    <br>        --> Finally, describe your learning experience in the course? <br>
        In this course I learned the purpose of the World Wide Web, and the HTTP protocol. How to develop web client applications that confirm to current standards and best practices, demonstrate competence with a document object model to present content for end-user consumption and/or interaction and ultilize JavaScript to implement interactivity in a web client application. Compose documents for the web using the hypertext mark-up language. Employ cascading style sheets to control the appearance of web documents. Solve a wide range of common web client programming problems.
